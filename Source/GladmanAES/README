This AES implementation is based on the Gladman implementation in xnu-863. 

The C files in this directory have been modified to produce no object code
unless the preprocessor symbol UseGladmanAES is defined (in aesopt.h).  If the
symbol is not defined, there some other AES implementation (such as AESedp)
must be supplied elsewhere in the build.
