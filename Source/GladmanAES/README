This AES implemented is based on the Gladman implementation in xnu-863. 

Mods to accomodate the CommonCryptor SPI are all flagged with CC_AES_COMMON_CRYPTO_SPI. The
interface to the public functions is backwards compatible with the xnu version (i.e.
this should plug & play with xnu if/when xniu links against libcommonCrypto_static.a).
